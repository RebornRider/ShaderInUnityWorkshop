# Introduction
This is the companion project to my Shader in Unity Workshop available [here](http://slides.com/kevingregoryagwaze/shaderinunityworkshop). 
All shaders that are part of the presentation are postfixed with "- Reference" 
and available in the material selection menu under "ShadersInUnityWorkshop/Reference/{PathToShader}".
